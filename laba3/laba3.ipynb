We\\'ll also never send you a chat message notifying you of a security related issue.\\n\\n_Finally, in the words of every gaming company anywhere, Reddit will never ask you for your password or 2FA codes._ Please report any suspicious messages by clicking the \"report\" option below each suspicious message, post or comment, or by filling out a report using reddit.com/report directly.\\n\\nNote: we\\'re aware that this isn\\'t currently visible if you\\'re using the iOS app, we\\'re working on a fix - in the meantime, if you\\'re ever unsure please view the profile from the desktop version of the site.',\n",
